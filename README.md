### Inspiration

Shout out to my girlfriend who passive aggressively sent me [this post](https://ifunny.co/picture/okay-so-hear-me-out-an-app-right-it-s-D8bQZLQU7) after we couldn't decide on where to eat. Really, Chicken Tinder would've been a great name, as suggested by the author of the aforementioned post.
